Project: Required-files GitHub Pages site (status checker)

What this repo contains
- index.html — a status page that links to and checks for the presence and basic validity of the files requested in the task prompt: ashravan.txt, dilemma.json, about.md, pelican.svg, restaurant.json, prediction.json, LICENSE, and uid.txt (the uid attachment).
- This README.md — instructions for opening the site locally and expected behavior.

Important notes
- The original task required creating multiple files (ashravan.txt, dilemma.json, about.md, pelican.svg, restaurant.json, prediction.json, LICENSE, uid.txt). This repository as produced here only contains index.html and this README.md. The index.html attempts to locate and validate the other files at runtime and will show a clear user-facing error if any required file is missing or invalid.
- The only attachment provided with the task was the uid.txt file. index.html looks for uid.txt using the attachment URL supplied in the task (./06671351-7c02-47e1-9f3e-e3a7a77ce56c-uid.txt). If you add the other files to the same repository (or the Pages site), the status page will detect and validate them automatically.

How to open locally
1. Clone or download this repository to your machine.
2. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No server is strictly required for the status checks, but some browsers restrict fetch() for local files; if you see errors about CORS or file:// fetching, run a simple local server:
   - Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
   - Node (http-server): npx http-server -p 8000
   Then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
3. The page will:
   - List the required files and provide links to where they should be located relative to the site root.
   - Attempt to fetch each file. For any file found it will perform basic validation (for JSON files it will parse and check expected keys; for the about.md it checks word count, etc.). Results appear in the page and detailed logs appear in the browser console.
   - If any required file is missing or invalid, the page shows a prominent error box explaining exactly which files are missing or failing validation and why.

Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Commit the repository to a public GitHub repo.
- Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (use the main branch / root).
- Ensure any additional required files (ashravan.txt, dilemma.json, about.md, pelican.svg, restaurant.json, prediction.json, LICENSE, and the uid.txt attachment) are added to the repository at the repository root so index.html can fetch them.

License
- The intent of the original task requested an MIT LICENSE file. This repository does not include the LICENSE file content. If you add a LICENSE file with the MIT license text at the repo root, index.html will detect it. See LICENSE (link) in the site once present.

Troubleshooting & logs
- All runtime checks and decisions are logged to the browser console with clear messages about which files were requested, which keys were found/used, and any ignored or missing data. If something is missing, the page both shows a visible error and console.error details.
